				<span class="first">A</span> signature dish is a recipe that identifies an individual chef. Ideally it should beunique and allow an informed gastronome to name the chef in a blind tasting. It canbe thought of as the culinary equivalent of an artist finding their own style, or anauthor finding their own voice. in practice a chef's signature dish often changeswith time or they may claim several signature dishes.

				<span class="first">I</span>n a weaker sense, a signature dish may become associated with an individualrestaurant, particularly if the chef who created it is no longer with the establishment. it can also be used to refer to a culinary region, in which case itsmeaning may be the equivalent of 'national dish'. In many cases, restaurants willbase their menu development on tastes and styles which are unique to the restaurant's geographical location. Local produce, restaurant d√©cor, and even thetype of building you choose can all contribute to a larger yield by taking on localsensibilities. Emphasizing (an establishment's) connection to its location providesgreat marketing possibilities.
