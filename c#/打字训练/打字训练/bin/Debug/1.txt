Now I know it's hard to make money. The summer vacation started, I decided to make money for the next semester, but I didn't know what work I could do; at that time, my mother was writing a book, I decided to type for her, she agreed, paid me yuan, I began to work, I typed too slowly, I can only type a few hundred words a day, which is a hard job for me. I've been typing all day.
