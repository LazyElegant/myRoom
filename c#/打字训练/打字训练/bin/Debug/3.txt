There has been a heated discussion on whether written examination is a good way to
evaluate students' learning ability. From my perspective, this form of test is unable to
assess one's true level of study.
To begin with, instead of testing students' learning ability, it is memory and exam techniques
that the examinations tend to test for. By that I mean, students tend to lay emphasis on the
content which will be tested. They are encouraged to memorize rather than to think. In other
words, those who get high scores on examinations do not necessarily possess strong learning
ability. For example, there are many stories that famous scientists and successful entrepreneurs
failed to do well on examinations.
