The UN works to maintain international peace and security in a world where security threats have
become more complex. Although the Organization has had many successes, there are also,
unfortunately, several recent tragic cases where the United Nations has not been so successful.
Hundreds of thousands have died around the world as conflicts have recently mounted.
The line has become increasingly blurred between criminals and hostile groups and peace
spoilers, including extremists with transnational strategies and sophisticated tactics.
The breakdown of the State security apparatus in intra-State and inter-communal
conflicts now poses tremendous security challenges and tests the Organizationâ€™s
capacity to carry out its mandates and programmes. And the UN, as a relatively soft target,
has been the victim of attacks resulting in the tragic loss of life.
With the mounting complexity and growing costs of addressing crisis situations,
the imperative of conflict prevention is higher than ever. In its conflict prevention and
mediation work, the United Nations continues to face challenges regarding how best to engage
with sometimes amorphous movements or fractured armed groups and how to ensure inclusivity.
