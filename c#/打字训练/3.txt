There has been a heated discussion on whether written examination is a good way to
evaluate students' learning ability. From my perspective, this form of test is unable to
assess one's true level of study.
To begin with, instead of testing students' learning ability, it is memory and exam techniques
that the examinations tend to test for. By that I mean, students tend to lay emphasis on the
content which will be tested. They are encouraged to memorize rather than to think. In other
words, those who get high scores on examinations do not necessarily possess strong learning
ability. For example, there are many stories that famous scientists and successful entrepreneurs
failed to do well on examinations.
Therefore, written examinations should be supplemented by other forms of assessments. For students
who major in art such as singing or acting, performance and presentation could be a better means of
testing their capability and personality. For students who learn science and technology, lab
experiments could be used to evaluate their innovation and operational ability. In such
circumstance, written examination by itself cannot provide a comprehensive and detailed assessment.
To conclude, although written examinations have been used as a common way for evaluation
for a long time, However, from the above mentioned, I am overall convinced that written
examination is not an ideal way and should be supplemented by other methods.
