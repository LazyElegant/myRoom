Enclosed is our new price list which will come into effect the end of this month.
You will see that we have increased our prices on most models.
We have, however, refrained from doing so on some models of which we hold large stocks.
The explanation for our increased prices stems from the fact that
we are now paying 10% more for our raw materials than we were paying last year,
along with some of our subcontractors having raised their prices as much as 15%.
As you know, we take great pride in our product an dare proud of the
reputation for quality and dependability we have built over 15years.
We will not compromise that reputation because of raising costs. We have, therefore,
decided to raise the price of some of our products.
We hope you will understand our position and look forward to your cooperation.
With best regards,
This is regarding our quotation dated 2 November,
and our mail offer dated 8 November concerning the supply of widgets.
We are prepared to keep our offer open until the end of this month.
